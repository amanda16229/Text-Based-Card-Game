# Text-Based-Card-Game
This game uses user input from the console to determine the category that will be judged. Each player has a deck of cards, each having their own designated amounts for each category. Since this card game is loosely inspired by "The Bachelor" categories include "style" and "sense of humor." There are still errors in the console on certain occasions.
